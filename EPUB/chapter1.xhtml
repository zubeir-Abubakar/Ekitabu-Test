					In a country called <em>Gabon</em>, a little village
						stood at the very edge of a forest.
						In the heart of this forest, in the highest
						branches of an enormous tree, lived a very
						special bird − the bird that made rain.

					For as far back as the villagers could
					remember, they had taken the time to keep
					this bird happy.They saved scraps of bread, pieces of fruit
					and fresh coconut milk, and every week or
					two a group of villagers took these delicacies
					into the forest. When they had laid them at
					the base of the tree, one of them played a
					simple tune on the thumb piano.

					After a while, the bird flew down to the
					ground to eat and drink. When she had
					finished, she began to sing the most
					beautiful song.
					At the same time, she raised her dark, shiny
					blue wings, and within minutes, the rain
					began to fall.

					This went on for many years. Because the
					rain fell regularly, the crops grew
					abundantly and there was plenty of food in
					the village.
					But gradually things began to change.
					Somehow, the villagers were always busy
					and they began to neglect the rain bird.
					"It will rain anyway," they said. "It's time to
					stop spoiling that silly old bird!"

						But the people were wrong. When they

						stopped falling.
						The crops began to dry up and die, and the
						animals grew thin and weak. Still, nobody in
						the village went into the forest to feed the
						bird that brought the rain. Now they were all
						too busy trying to find money to buy food in
						the neighbouring town.

						One scorching day, a young girl called <strong><em>Ketti</em></strong> 
						decided to go into the forest after school. "At
						least it will be cool in there," she thought.
						She walked and walked, and after some
						time, she came to the tall tree in which the
						rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree.
						Suddenly, she remembered how her granny
						had taken her into the forest to feed the bird
						when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened
						her school bag and pulled out a piece of
						bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she
						laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then
						because she had no thumb piano, she sang
						an old song that she had known all her life.

							With a loud whooshing sound, a beautiful
							blue bird swooped out of the branches
							above Ketti's head and began to eat the
							bread. When the bird had finished, she
							opened her mouth and sang a few pure,
							high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings
							and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble
							of thunder. By the time she reached her
							home, giant rain drops were pelting down,
							cooling the baking red earth.

					Ketti was very happy, until she told her
					parents what had happened.
					"Don't be silly!" scolded her mother. "Nobody
					believes that bird has anything to do with
					the rain anymore!"
					"Your mother is right," said Ketti's father.
					"The drought has been broken now and we
					will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread
					feeding that greedy old bird again!"
					Though Ketti didn't argue with her parents,
					she felt sure they were wrong.
					"If only Granny were still alive," she said to
					herself, "she would have believed me!"
					But Ketti's granny had died a few years
					earlier. The only thing Ketti had left, was her
					<em>granny's old thumb piano</em>.

				Two weeks passed and there was no more
				rain. The crops began to shrivel up again
				and the hungry animals' ribs began to stick
				out even more. The sun beat down
				mercilessly from a glaring blue sky.
				"I don't care what they say!" thought Ketti.
				"We need rain. I'm going to feed the bird
				again tomorrow!"

					So, early the next morning, after taking a
					slice of bread and a handful of red berries
					from the kitchen, Ketti slipped out of the
					house. She began to make her way to the
					centre of the forest.
					What she didn't realise, was that her father
					was also awake. When he saw what his
					daughter was doing, he realised that she
					was going to feed the rain bird again.

						"I'll teach that child a lesson!" he said to
						himself angrily. He snatched his bow and
						arrows and silently followed Ketti into the
						forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the
						food that Ketti had set out for it, her father
						raised his bow and released his deadly
						arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's
						heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek.
						Terrified, Ketti spun around − just in time to
						see her father fall down, stone dead. Ketti
						screamed and turned around − just in time
						to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the
						bird's glossy body.
						Then the bird, unharmed, swooped up into
						the highest branch of the tree.</p>

						Ketti raced out of the forest to a scene of

						With a pounding heart, she ran all the way
						back to her home.
						She quickly found her granny's old thumb
						piano. "This is my only hope!" she thought.
						"The rain bird is angry. I have to make her
						happy again! I HAVE to!"</p>

						Half an hour later, Ketti was back at the

						with sweat and she was gasping for breath.
						A few paces away from her lay the lifeless

						Ketti looked away quickly, and with
						trembling hands, began to play the thumb
						piano. She played and played, until her

					Finally, what she wanted most in the world
					happened.
					Down swooped the bird as if nothing had
					happened. The bird ate some of the berries
					still lying on the ground and sang a few
					notes. Then, as Ketti played on, the bird
					raised her wings.
					Ketti heard a rustle behind her.
